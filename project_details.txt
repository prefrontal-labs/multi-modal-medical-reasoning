# Multimodal Medical Reasoning 🧠🏥

A research-oriented framework for **multimodal medical reasoning**, combining
medical images, clinical text, and structured patient data to produce
**interpretable, evidence-grounded clinical decisions**.

---

## 🔬 Research Motivation

Clinical reasoning rarely depends on a single modality. Physicians integrate:
- Radiology images (X-rays, CT, MRI)
- Clinical notes and reports
- Structured EHR data
- Medical knowledge and guidelines

This project investigates **how multimodal foundation models reason in medical
settings**, focusing on:
- Cross-modal reasoning
- Evidence grounding
- Reduction of hallucinations
- Clinical consistency

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Build multimodal models for medical reasoning
- Study **fusion strategies** (early, late, cross-attention)
- Evaluate **reasoning quality**, not just accuracy
- Introduce **agent-based clinical reasoning workflows**
- Analyze failure modes and hallucinations

## 🧠 Modalities Used

| Modality | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| Vision | Chest X-ray, MRI, CT |
| Text | Radiology reports, discharge summaries |
| Structured | Lab values, vitals |
| Knowledge | Clinical guidelines |
